# Freesurfer4Windows

The idea of Freesurfer4Windows is an install script that will allow you to run [Freesurfer](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/) on Windows using [WSL] (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about).
The automated script will perform multiple operations.
- Enabling the WSL Subsystem on Windows 10
- Download and Install of a Ubuntu Distribution
- Download and Configuration Freesurfer to run on Windows
- Installing and enabling [XLaunch] (https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/) to enable Freeview
